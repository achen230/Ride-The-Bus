# Ride The Bus 🃏

A fun Python-based card game simulator inspired by the party game *Ride the Bus*.

The program simulates 1,000 rounds of the game and visualizes the number of attempts needed to win using a bar chart.

### Features
- Fully randomized deck shuffling and drawing
- Multiple game stages: color call, higher/lower, in-between/outside, and suit guess
- Statistical analysis using `Counter` and `matplotlib`

### How to Run
```bash
python ride_the_bus.py
```

Simple 👍

Here's what the output would look like:
